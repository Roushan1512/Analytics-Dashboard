This is the Assignment given to me by Writomat to make a Social Media Analytics Dashboard Using ReactJs for frontend and Java SpringBoot for backend.

--> I have used MongoDb as the database and also used FakerJs dependency to create dummy data.

--> I have also integrated Auth0 with the frontend for easy login.

--> My apologies for using a basic design as I have never been a good designer but I can make good frontend apps from given designs.
